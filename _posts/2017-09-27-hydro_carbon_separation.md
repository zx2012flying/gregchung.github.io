## Hydrocarbon separations
Separation of p-xylenes from other xylene isomers is one of the most important separations in chemical industry. More than 80% of the world production of xylenes is used for the production of p-xylene, which is a feedstock to produce terephthalic acid – a monomer used in the production of polyethylene terephthalate (PET). PET is widely used in our daily lives in the production of beverage bottles, fibers and films. Separation of alkane isomers, such as hexane isomers, is also an important separation task in petrochemical industry. More than 94% of the transportation energy spent in the U.S. in 2010 is based on gasoline, and hexane isomers are major components of the gasoline, comprising more than 10% by volume. Both separations are challenging because traditional, energy-intensive separation process, such as distillation, is practically impossible due to closely matched vapor pressure between the isomers.

Our group is working on design and development of new adsorbent materials that can efficiently separate hydrocarbons.
